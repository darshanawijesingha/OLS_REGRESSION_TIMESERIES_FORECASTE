# ðŸ›’ Sales Forecasting for Newly Opened Outlet - 2025

This project tracks and analyzes the growth of a newly launched outlet from its opening on **June 10, 2025**, to reaching a major sales milestone of **â‚¨1,000,000 per day**.

## ðŸ“Š Objective

Using **OLS Regression**, I attempted to forecast the number of days it would take for the outlet to achieve â‚¨1M in daily sales. Based on early trends, the model predicted the milestone would be reached **118 days** after launch â€” on **October 6, 2025**.

However, reality had other plans â€” the store hit **â‚¨1M/day** a **day earlier**, on **October 5, 2025**! ðŸ”¥
